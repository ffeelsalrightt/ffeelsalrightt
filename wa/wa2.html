        <p>
            I'm a 4th year at <strong>CU Boulder</strong>, but I've still got a lot of learning to do. I started playing with basic web development in<br> 
            HTML and CSS at the end of last semester when I had free time. I know that web development is a really valuable tool <br>
            in today's day and age, and I want to learn how to design websites by hopefully remaking <a href="https://edwinmcarthur.myportfolio.com/">my portfolio website</a> <br>
            from the ground up!
