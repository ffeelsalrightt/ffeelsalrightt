    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p><em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>(colloquially known as <em>FNAF</em>), is an indie horror game franchise 
        created by Scott Cawthon. The first <em>FNAF</em> game was released on <time datetime="2014-08-08">August 8th of 2014</time>, and due to its
        creative horror setting, rich environmental storytelling, and novel, resource-management approach to the 
        survival horror genre was met with strong praise from both critics and casual gamers alike. After many
        popular video game content creators such as Markiplier and The Game Theorists brought large-scale publicity
        to the games, Cawthon followed up with a flurry of sequels including <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em>, 
        <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</em>, and <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 4</em> all releasing within less
        than a year of the original game. On <time datetime="2021-06-14">June 14th of 2021</time>, on the seventh anniversary of the release of the first trailer 
        for the original game, Scott Cawthon announced that he would be retiring from making the <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>
        games, placing Steel Wool Studios in charge of future installments. As of <time datetime="2024-02-01">February 2024</time>, the franchise consists of 11 games, 19 books, and 
        a feature-length film with no end in sight.

    <h2>Creation of <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em></h2>
    <p>Scott Cawthon began making games in the mid-to-late 1990's with several self-funded, Christian adventure games. However, it wasn't 
        until 2012 when he would begin to pick up traction as a game developer with <em>A Desolate Hope</em>. One year later, however, 
        Cawthon would once again be panned after his submission of <em>Chipper & Sons Lumber Co.</em> to Steam Greenlight. Many players would 
        call Cawthon's models of the anthropomorphic animals creepy and uncanny. Unable to find his footing as a game developer and struggling 
        to support his family on his minimum-wage job at the local Dollar General, Scott would only attempt to make one more game before 
        finally putting his dreams of game development behind him. Taking the criticisms he'd received from <em>Chipper & Sons Lumber Co.</em>, 
        Cawthon would embrace the uncanny, creepy style of design and create a new cast of anthropomorphic characters based on the animatronics
        used at family entertainment establishments like Chuck E. Cheese. This game would go on to be <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>.
