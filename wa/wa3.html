    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em></a> (colloquially known as <em>FNAF</em>), is an indie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_game">horror game</a> franchise 
        created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Cawthon/">Scott Cawthon</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_(video_game)">first <em>FNAF</em> game</a> was released on <time datetime="2014-08-08">August 8th of 2014</time>, and due to its
        creative horror setting, rich environmental storytelling, and novel, resource-management approach to the 
        survival horror genre was met with strong praise from both critics and casual gamers alike. After many
        popular video game content creators such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markiplier">Markipler</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MatPat">MatPat</a> brought large-scale publicity
        to the games, Cawthon followed up with a flurry of sequels including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_2"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em></a>, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_3"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</em></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_4"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's 4</em></a> all releasing within less
        than a year of the original game. On <time datetime="2021-06-14">June 14th of 2021</time>, on the seventh anniversary of the release of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP4UTOek0-Y">first trailer</a> 
        for the original game, Scott Cawthon announced that he would be retiring from making the <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>
        games, placing Steel Wool Studios in charge of future installments. As of <time datetime="2024-02-01">February 2024</time>, the franchise consists of 11 games, 19 books, and 
        a feature-length film with no end in sight.

            Scott Cawthon began making games in the mid-to-late 1990's with several self-funded, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians">Christian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game">adventure games</a>. However, it wasn't 
            until 2012 when he would begin to pick up traction as a game developer with <em>A Desolate Hope</em>. One year later, however, 
            Cawthon would once again be panned after his submission of <em>Chipper & Sons Lumber Co.</em> to Steam Greenlight. Many players would 
            call Cawthon's models of the anthropomorphic animals creepy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny">uncanny</a>. Unable to find his footing as a game developer and struggling 
            to support his family on his minimum-wage job at the local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_General">Dollar General</a>, Scott would only attempt to make one more game before 
            finally putting his dreams of game development behind him. Taking the criticisms he'd received from <em>Chipper & Sons Lumber Co.</em>, 
            Cawthon would embrace the uncanny, creepy style of design and create a new cast of anthropomorphic characters based on the animatronics
            used at family entertainment establishments like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_E._Cheese">Chuck E. Cheese</a>. This game would go on to be <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>.

            Seeing the explosive success of the first game, Scott Cawthon immediately began working on <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em>, releasing the game on <time datetime="2014-11-10">November 10th, 2014</time>, 
            just three months after later. Approaching the game with a much more hopeful tone than the first, Cawthon also began to take advantage of the virality of the game by sending out early "extended demos" to 
            Youtube content creators that had helped with the sucess of the first game. These extended demos would allow access to the third night of the game, as opposed to the two nights acessible in the normal version of the demo.
            Cawthon would expand on the mechanics and difficulty of the original game, adding seven new main animatronic characters (as well as five new minor easter egg characters) on top of the five seen in the original game. 
            <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em> would also expand on the hidden lore of the first game that had sparked lots of discussion online.

            While creator Scott Cawthon made the original <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em> game without any expectation or pretense of success, 
            he went into the creation of the next two games with a distinct vision. During the creation of <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em>, Cawthon
            had a clear vision of the plot of both the second game as well as the third, which lead him to beginning work on <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</em>
            near immediately after the release of <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em>. He foresaw the infamous Purple Guy finally being revealed in the third game,
            and that it would be the final game in the series. Hinted at in one of the Phone Guy's voicelines in <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em>, Purple Guy would
            wear a yellow suit. Little did fans know, it would not be the infamous Golden Freddy, but another suit known as Golden Bonnie, or rather, Springtrap.
            Scott would continue using his typical stream-of-consciousness style of 3D modeling to design the character, adding to the broken, decrepit feeling that it conveys.
            Cawthon would reveal the trailer for <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</em> on <time datetime="2015-01-26">the 26th of January, 2015</time>, following up his incredibly 
            quick turnaround on the second game. While Cawthon would take a bit more time to release the game, releasing for PC on <time datetime="2015-03-02">the 2nd of March, 2015</time>,
            fans wouldn't take any more time to tear it apart for secrets.

            Upon the release of the first game on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a>, <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em> received many very positive reviews, 
            earning an overall Very Positive status from the website. Many famous video game content creators (especially from websites such as YouTube) including Markipler, MatPat, Jacksepticeye,
            PewDiePie, and many others began to record and upload videos of themselves playing the game, leading to an explosion of popularity online. While Youtuber creators like Markiplier saw great success
            and upwards of hundreds of millions of views simply playing the game, MatPat and other Youtube creators also found lots of success by dissecting the game's hidden lore.

            Though surprised due to the release of <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em> only 3 months after the release of the first game, the community around the franchise did not take any time before
            immediately diving into everything it had to offer. Similar to the release of the first game, the Steam page for <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 2</em> was bombed with thousands of positive reviews
            before the game even released, and still holds its status as overall Very Positive on Steam to this day. Due to Scott Cawthon sending out early extended demos to Youtubers such as Markiplier, 
            the success of the game franchise only grew from the viral status of the first.

            Upon the first tease for <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</em>, excitement around the franchise was at an all-time high. The third installment in the most popular game trilogy in years 
            was not to be overlooked by the internet, especially considering what it would mean for players who were focused on putting together the hidden lore. Upon the game's release, <em>Five Nights at Freddy's 3</em> 
            would be once again flooded with positive reviews from fans; however, talk about the game's jumpscares not being scary enough would circulate as well. While this is the definite end of the 
            original <em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em> trilogy, Cawthon would continue to try and keep fans entertained for many more years with games that further expanded the story.
