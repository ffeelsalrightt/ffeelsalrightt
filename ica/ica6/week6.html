    <div class="box">this is a div. it has a 5 pixel thick border 
        (the line on the perimeter of the box) and 20 pixels of padding (space between the text and the border).
        <br>it also has 50 pixels of margin (the space between the outside of the border and the edge of the screen).
    </div>
    <div id="anotherbox">this is another div. instead of using a class, it uses an id. this means that
        you would call it by a hash mark rather than a period in your style sheet.
